## **Schema Overview (Aligned with ERD)**

1. **Authenticated Users (`AuthUser`)**
   - Stores detailed information about authenticated users.
   - Key Relationships:
     - **Self Reports:** One-to-One relationship with `NumerologyReportAuth`.
     - **Friendships:** Many-to-Many relationship through the `friend_association` table.
     - **Friend Requests:** Managed via the `FriendRequest` table.

2. **Public Users (`User`)**
   - Represents non-authenticated users with minimal attributes: `name`, `dob`, and `gender`.
   - Reusability: Avoids duplication by reusing user data (e.g., common `dob` and `gender`) for multiple guest reports.

3. **Numerology Reports**
   - **Personal Reports (`NumerologyReportAuth`):** 
     - Linked to `AuthUser` for private, detailed reports.
     - Report data is stored in a JSON-based field (`report_data`) for flexibility.
   - **Public Reports (`NumerologyReport`):**
     - Linked to `User` with optional overrides for names using `person_name`.
     - Enables better organization when a single user is referenced multiple times via foreign keys.
   - **Shared Data (`SubReport`):**
     - Stores reusable JSON data (`dob`, `gender`) for multiple common reports.
     - Optimized with indexed fields for efficient querying.

4. **Compatibility Matching**
   - **Compatibility Reports (`CompatibilityReport`):**
     - Links two users with a shared `SubMatch` for compatibility data.
   - **Shared Compatibility Data (`SubMatch`):**
     - Stores reusable compatibility data in JSON format.
     - Optimized with indexed attributes for rapid retrieval.

5. **Auxiliary Features**
   - **Email Subscriptions (`EmailSubscription`):**
     - Tracks subscribed emails for newsletters or updates.
   - **Report Issues (`ReportIssues`):**
     - Logs and manages issues or complaints related to `NumerologyReport`.
